Our project revolves around a household in France (cityâ€™s name), where we have obtained
their energy consumption data over the years. To be precise, we have the energy consumption data by the
minute for this particular household. In addition to this, we have also obtained the power consumption
data that we will be utilized in this project. The data we obtained for the household is divided into three
parts, submetering 1, submetering 2 and submetering 3. Submetering 1 data (in watt-hour of active energy)
corresponds to the kitchen, consisting of a dishwasher, an oven, and a microwave. Submetering 2 data (in
watt-hour of active energy) corresponds to the laundry room, including a washing machine, a tumble-drier,
a refrigerator and a light. Submetering 3 data (in watt-hour of active energy) corresponds to an electric
water heater and an air-conditioner. Our project aims to utilize this data and help them conserve their
energy better by using data science. We will be implementing the time of use pricing to observe how their
electricity bill and energy consumption vary and if this would help them. Furthermore, we will follow their
consumption pattern and predict their future consumption, which would allow us to suggest ways to conserve
energy for each submetering type. This process would include identifying the device that is consuming the
most energy at a particular time and if we could take measures to reduce the consumption of this device or
replace this with another more energy-efficient appliance. We would also suggest the best time to use this
device to conserve energy efficiently.
